```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:Path += ";$HOME\AppData\Local\Pub\Cachein"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```bash
flutter_project_setup
```

Follow the interactive flow:

2. Select architecture
3. Choose Git template or empty project
4. Choose whether to initialize Git
5. Add `.gitignore`
6. Optionally provide a JSON file for model generation
7. Select libraries to install

## Example json model

{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  },
  "object": {
    "id": 101,

After the project has been created in the model, the User and Object classes will be created.
